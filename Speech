Good afternoon, everyone,

It’s a pleasure to be speaking with you today at this townhall, and I’m especially honored to talk about a value that lies at the heart of who we are at TCS – Respect for the Individual.

In an organization as large and diverse as ours, made up of around 600,000 people across geographies, cultures, and disciplines, respect isn’t just a virtue – it's a necessity. It is the foundation of trust, inclusion, and collaboration.

When we speak of respect for the individual, it’s not just about being polite or courteous. It’s about acknowledging the unique perspectives, experiences, and strengths each one of us brings to the table. It's about recognizing that every voice matters  - whether it's a new joiner or a seasoned leader.

What Does Respect Look Like in Action?

Listening actively – not just hearing, but understanding.

Empowering others – giving space for ideas, creativity, and ownership.

Creating psychological safety – where people feel safe to speak up without fear.

Embracing diversity – of thought, background, and style.


These are not abstract ideals – they show up in our daily choices. In how we run meetings, mentor juniors, respond to disagreements, or even manage stress.

Why Is It So Important?

Respect is what drives collaboration in our global teams. It fosters innovation, because people are more likely to contribute boldly when they feel valued. And it builds loyalty, because individuals are more likely to stay and grow in an environment where they are truly seen and respected.

At TCS, respect is embedded in our Culture of Ownership – where every associate is treated not just as an employee, but as a stakeholder in our shared mission. We don’t just work for the company – we grow with it.

So let me leave you with this thought: How are we showing respect for the individual – not just in words, but in action? Are we truly listening? Are we being inclusive in our decisions? Are we taking the time to recognize the contributions of those around us?

Let’s commit ourselves to this value – because when individuals feel respected, the organization becomes unstoppable.

Thank you.
